## Presenters

This community call will be led by [Pawel Palucki](https://github.com/ppalucki).

## Topicss

This meeting will explore the uses of [CRI-resource-manager](https://github.com/intel/cri-resource-manager), a Container Runtime Interface proxy service for Kubernetes that boasts workload placement policies with hardware resource awareness.

Viewers will understand what problems CRI-resource-manager solves and what quality of life features are a must-have for an extension to become "ready to production". Later on in the meeting, a demonstration will be given on how to dynamically configure Gardener extension and debug propagation when it fails.

Q&A is planned after the main part to look at any issues you might have encountered. Come join us!
