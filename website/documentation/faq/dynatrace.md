Monitoring your Kubernetes deployments is possible through the use of Dynatrace or Prometheus.

Learn how to connect Dynatrace to your Kubernetes based deployments on SAP BTP by following the [Dynatrace for Kubernetes Monitoring](https://pages.github.tools.sap/apm/docs/installation/kubernetes/) guide.

You can also read about [monitoring your Kubernetes applications](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/development/monitoring-stack.md).
